utilMultilevels expects certain parameters to exist when it creates the listed parameters. This is no good because we can't expect the same parameters to exist always.

datasaver.Dataset now hard codes the labrad connection host to 'jingle'. This is really bad coding but I did this so that seperate LabRAD colonies can all store to the same datavault. In the end we need to make this a bit more elegant.

Remove hard coded unit conversion from pyle.envelopes. This should be deferred until the point that we actually know the sample rate of the DAC, ie. in the qubit sequencer.

Specify dataset class and plotting routines
